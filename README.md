# PicPack  üñºÔ∏è

[PicPack](https://picpack.streamlit.app/) is a web application that helps you rename and compress your images with ease. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for uploading image files, which are then resized and compressed before being packaged into a zip file for download.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Image Renaming**: Automatically renames uploaded images in numerical order.
- **Image Compression**: Compresses images to reduce file size while maintaining quality.
- **Downloadable Zip File**: Provides a zip file containing all renamed and compressed images for easy download.

## Usage üöÄ

1. Visit the [PicPack](https://picpack.streamlit.app/) website.
2. Click on the "Upload images" button and select one or more image files from your device.
3. Once uploaded, the images will be displayed on the screen.
4. Click on the "Download renamed_files.zip" button to download the zip file containing the renamed and compressed images.

## How It Works 

- **Image Renaming**: Uploaded images are automatically renamed in numerical order (e.g., 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.).
- **Image Compression**: Each uploaded image is resized to half its original dimensions and compressed using JPEG format with 85% quality.
- **Zip File Creation**: The renamed and compressed images are packaged into a zip file for easy download.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Streamlit**: Streamlit is used for building the web interface and handling user interactions.
- **Pillow**: Pillow is a Python Imaging Library used for image processing tasks such as resizing and compression.
- **Python**: The backend logic of the application is written in Python.

## Deployment üöÄ

The application is deployed using [Streamlit Sharing](https://streamlit.io/sharing). Streamlit Sharing allows for easy deployment of Streamlit applications without the need for managing servers or infrastructure.
